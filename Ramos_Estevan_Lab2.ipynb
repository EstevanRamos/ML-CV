Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS):**\n","Water has the ability to dissolve a wide range of inorganic and some organic minerals or salts such as potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, magnesium, sulfates etc. The water with high TDS value indicates that water is highly mineralized. \n","\n","**4.
